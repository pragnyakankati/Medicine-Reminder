MEDICINE REMINDER SYSTEM

The Medicine Reminder System is a user-friendly device designed to help users keep track of their medication schedule. 
It allows users to set reminders for taking medicine either once, twice, or thrice a day using simple buttons. 
When it's time to take the medicine, a buzzer sounds an alert, an LED light turns on, and the name of the medicine is displayed on an LCD screen. 
This ensures that users do not miss their medication and do not have to refer to their prescriptions every time.

COMPONENTS:

Buttons: Used to set the reminder frequency (once, twice, thrice a day).
Real-Time Clock (RTC): Tracks the current time to trigger reminders accurately.
Buzzer: Sounds an alert when it is time to take the medicine.

Microcontroller: The central unit that manages the time tracking, user input, and triggering the alerts.
